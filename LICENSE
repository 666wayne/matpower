The code in MATPOWER is distributed under the GNU General Public
License with an exception added to clarify our intention to allow
MATPOWER to interface with Matlab itself as well as any other M-files
or MEX-files a user may have installed, regardless of their licensing
terms. The full text of the GPL can be found in the COPYING file
at the top level of the MATPOWER distribution.

The MATPOWER case files distributed with MATPOWER are not covered
by the GPL. In most cases, the data has either been included with
permission or has been converted from data available from a public
source.

While not required by the terms of the license, we do request that
publications derived from the use of MATPOWER explicitly acknowledge
that fact by citing [1].
